# Day 5 - Completed AZ-900!

## Introduction

I spent a few more days to familiarise with the contents of AZ-900 and took a few more practice exams. The results of the practice exams were satisfying so I went for the real exam.

## Cloud Research

The practice exams really helped a lot. The questions are very similar so I was quite prepared after finishing all the practices. I got a score of 835/1000 and I was quite satisfied. To be honest I didn't know that there are so many things to be remembered for Azure Certificates. I think I will put some more time to learn about the common programming knowledge (I'm a newbie to all of these) and get back to Azure later.

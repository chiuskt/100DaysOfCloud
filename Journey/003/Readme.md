# Day 3 - first attempt on a pratice exam

## Introduction

I spent a few days to learn the fundamentals on AZ-900 and took a pratice exam online.

## Cloud Research

The practice exam consists of 55 multiple choice questions (which I think is simpler than a normal exam). I thought I did a good job based on the amount of time I spent to study. There are so much things to memerise and I think I have to work harder to pass the real exam. Especially on the core solution and cost management.

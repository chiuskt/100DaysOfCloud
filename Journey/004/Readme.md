# Day 4 - more attempts on practice exam

## Introduction

I spent a few more days to learn the fundamentals on AZ-900. Tried to memorise the core solutions of Azure and took 2 more practice exams.

## Cloud Research

I was not so prepared for my second attempt and I was in a rush at that time. The result turned out to be unsatisfactory so I decided to work harder on the core solutions. The third attempt went quite well but I was not very confident when I took the exam. There are still room of improvement. I hope that I can take the real exam in a week or 2.
